# Clustering Projects - McDonald's Case Study Conversion from R to Python

# Overview
This repository contains the Python code for converting McDonald's Market Segmentation Case Study from R to Python. The goal of this project was to replicate the R-based clustering analysis and visualization techniques in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and other Python libraries.

The case study applies k-means clustering on customer data to segment customers based on their preferences and demographic data. Additionally, it includes evaluations of cluster stability, segment profiling using decision trees, and visualizations of the results.
